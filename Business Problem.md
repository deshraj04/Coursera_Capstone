# Introduction

## Objective

This project seeks to identity the similarities or differences in Arts & Entertainment, Food and Nightlife between New York City and Toronto.


## Business Problem

New Your City, USA and Toronto, CA are two of the most visited places by tourists. Moreover, they also offer various work opportunities, and are thus the cities where people from all around the world move to for a better life. 

Both tourists and those who plan to move to another city often look for places of enjoyment, social activities and entertainment before considering a city.  Although, Google and Question & Answer platforms such as Quora give you many options to explore and learn about a city, most of information is based on subjective knowledge of individuals who have traveled or moved to such places. 

While that is good a option to learn about a place, data driven information is a better way to inform yourself and also is more reliable. Keeping in mind that individuals who wish to travel or move to New York City or Toronto are unsure of which is the better place from enjoyment perspective, this project compares three categories between the two cities. These categories include Arts & Entertainment, Food and Nightlife.

Example of some of the questions the project seeks to answer:
1. How frequent Japanese Restaurants are in the neighborhoods of Toronto as compared to New York City?
2. If Museums play an important role in deciding which place to tour, then should you choose Toronto or New York City?
3. If Art Gallaries are your favorite place to explore in your free time, then would it matter much if you choose to visit New York City rather than Toronto?


## Tareget Audience

The tareget audience of this project is tourists and also the people who want to decide between the New York City and Toronto based on Food, Nightlife and Arts & Entertainment venues in the neighborhoods of the two cities.
